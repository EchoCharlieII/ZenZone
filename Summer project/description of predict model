Hi guys, here's our first predict model! 
Since the file size is too large to put it ion github, I save it into google drive, here's the link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14y_r7r_NfqpXb8QiZ0GefYIDbCRWP9Tm?usp=drive_link
So there're 69 taxi zones in NYC and we'll create every pickel file for each taxi zone, just like what we did in the dublin bike project.
And this is the first one, I will continue to upload the rest to this drive。
Input to this model should be like time_of_day group by 15 mins，eg:00:00:00AM is 0, 00:15:00 is 15 and 00:30:00 is 30.....
output will be calm rate of every zone, which is a number between 0 and 1
For now we have average calm rate of every zone, we also will have more specific information like precise calm rate to each street node. 
We will be working on these in more detail over the next few days。
